# Election Audit

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to analyze election data from a CSV file to come up with the candidate and county that won. In order to accomplish this goal, we used Python. Through this project we learned how to read data from a CSV file, analyze the data to get the desired result, and finally write that result to a text file.

## Results
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
There were 369,711 votes cast.

Jefferson county received 38,855 votes, which is 10.5% of the total vote. Denver received 306,055 votes, which is 82.8% of the total vote. Finally, Arapahoe received 24,801 votes, which is 6.7% of the total votes.

Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes, which was 73.8% of the total vote.

## Summary
After completing this project, I learned that Python is a powerful tool that can produce quick, accurate results. Furthermore, this script can be adapted for future elections. For example, if we want to
